      ! Rarefaction is enabled
      i Rarefaction is being performed with a set seed. This will ensure that the results are reproducible, but will not allow for randomness in the subsampling process.
      i Rarefaction is a process that randomly subsamples the data to a specified depth. This is done to account for differences in sequencing depth between samples. However, this process is not without controversy. Rarefaction can lead to loss of information and can also lead to false positives in differential abundance testing.
