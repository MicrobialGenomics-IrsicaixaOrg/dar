Description: Differential abundance testing in microbiome data challenges both 
    parametric and non-parametric statistical methods, due to its sparsity, high 
    variability and compositional nature. Microbiome-specific statistical 
    methods often assume classical distribution models or take into account 
    compositional specifics. These produce results that range within the 
    specificity vs sensitivity space in such a way that type I and type II error 
    that are difficult to ascertain in real microbiome data when a single method 
    is used. Recently, a consensus approach based on multiple differential 
    abundance (DA) methods was recently suggested in order to increase robustness. 
    With dar, you can use dplyr-like pipeable sequences of DA methods and then 
    apply different consensus strategies. In this way we can obtain more reliable 
    results in a fast, consistent and reproducible way.
