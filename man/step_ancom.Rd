\arguments{
\item{rec}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of operations for
this recipe.}

\item{out_cut}{Numerical fraction between 0 and 1. For each taxon, observations with
proportion of mixture distribution less than out_cut will be detected as outlier
zeros; while observations with proportion of mixture distribution greater than 1 -
out_cut will be detected as outlier values.}

\item{zero_cut}{Numerical fraction between 0 and 1. Taxa with proportion of zeroes
greater than zero_cut are not included in the analysis.}

\item{lib_cut}{Numeric. Samples with library size less than lib_cut are not included in
the analysis.}

\item{neg_lb}{Logical. TRUE indicates a taxon would be classified as a structural zero
in the corresponding experimental group using its asymptotic lower bound. More
specifically, neg_lb = TRUE indicates you are using both criteria stated in section
3.2 of ANCOM-II to detect structural zeros; Otherwise, neg_lb = FALSE will only use
the equation 1 in section 3.2 of ANCOM-II for declaring structural zeros.}

\item{p_adj_method}{Character. Specifying the method to adjust p-values for multiple
comparisons. Default is “BH” (Benjamini-Hochberg procedure).}

\item{alpha}{Level of significance. Default is 0.05.}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}

\value{
An object of class \code{recipe}

\description{
This function performs an analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM). ANCOM
accounts for the underlying structure in the data and can be used for comparing the
composition of microbiomes in two or more populations. ANCOM makes no distributional
assumptions and can be implemented in a linear model framework to adjust for covariates
as well as model longitudinal data.
