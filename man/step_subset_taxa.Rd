\title{Subset species by taxonomic expression}
\usage{
step_subset_taxa(rec, expr, id = rand_id("subset_taxa"))

\S4method{step_subset_taxa}{recipe}(rec, expr, id = rand_id("subset_taxa"))
}
\arguments{
\item{rec}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of
operations for this recipe.}

\item{expr}{The subsetting expression that should be applied to the
taxonomyTable. This is passed on to subset, and more details and examples
about how it functions can be found in its documentation.}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{recipe}
}
\description{
This is a convenience wrapper around the subset function. It is intended to
speed subsetting complex experimental objects with one function call. In the
case of subset_taxa, the subsetting will be based on an expression related to
the columns and values within the tax_table (taxonomyTable component) slot of
physeq. The OTUs retained in the dataset is equivalent to \code{x[subset &
!is.na(subset)]}, where x is the vector of OTU IDs and subset is the logical
that results from your subsetting expression. This is important to keep in
mind, as users are often unaware that this subsetting step also removes/omits
OTUs that have a missing value result, NA, somewhere in the expression.
