\arguments{
\item{rec}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of
operations for this recipe.}

\item{count_cutoff}{Indicates the minimum number of methods in which an OTU
must be present (Default: NULL). If count_cutoff is NULL count_cutoff is
equal to \code{length(steps_ids(rec, "da")) - length(exclude)}}

\item{weights}{Named vector with the ponderation value for each method.}

\item{exclude}{Method ids to exclude.}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{prep_recipe}
}
\description{
For a prep recipe with add step to define the result extraction method.
