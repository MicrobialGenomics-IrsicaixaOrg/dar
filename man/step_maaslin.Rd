\arguments{
\item{rec}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of operations for
this recipe.}

\item{min_abundance}{The minimum abundance for each feature.}

\item{min_prevalence}{The minimum percent of samples for which a feature is detected at
minimum abundance.}

\item{min_variance}{Keep features with variance greater than.}

\item{normalization}{The normalization method to apply.}

\item{transform}{The transform to apply.}

\item{analysis_method}{The transform to apply.}

\item{max_significance}{The q-value threshold for significance.}

\item{random_effects}{The random effects for the model, comma-delimited for multiple
effects.}

\item{correction}{The correction method for computing the q-value.}

\item{standardize}{Apply z-score so continuous metadata are on the same scale.}

\item{reference}{The factor to use as a reference for a variable with more than two
levels provided as a string of 'variable,reference' semi-colon delimited for multiple
variables.}

\item{rarefy}{Boolean indicating if OTU counts must be rarefyed. This rarefaction uses
the standard R sample function to resample from the abundance values in the otu_table
component of the first argument, physeq. Often one of the major goals of this
procedure is to achieve parity in total number of counts between samples, as an
alternative to other formal normalization procedures, which is why a single value for
the sample.size is expected.}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{recipe}
}
\description{
MaAsLin2 finds associations between microbiome meta-omics features and complex metadata
in population-scale epidemiological studies. The software includes multiple analysis
methods (including support for multiple covariates and repeated measures), filtering,
normalization, and transform options to customize analysis for your specific study.
