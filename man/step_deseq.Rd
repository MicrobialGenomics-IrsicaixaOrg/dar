\arguments{
\item{rec}{A Recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of
operations for this Recipe.}

\item{test}{Either "Wald" or "LRT", which will then use either Wald
significance tests (defined by nbinomWaldTest), or the likelihood ratio
test on the difference in deviance between a full and reduced model formula
(defined by nbinomLRT).}

\item{fitType}{either "parametric", "local", "mean", or "glmGamPoi" for the
type of fitting of dispersions to the mean intensity. See
estimateDispersions for description.}

\item{betaPrior}{whether or not to put a zero-mean normal prior on the
non-intercept coefficients See nbinomWaldTest for description of the
calculation of the beta prior. In versions >=1.16, the default is set to
FALSE, and shrunken LFCs are obtained afterwards using lfcShrink.}

\item{type}{"apeglm" is the adaptive Student's t prior shrinkage estimator
from the 'apeglm' package; "ashr" is the adaptive shrinkage estimator from
the 'ashr' package, using a fitted mixture of normals prior - see the
Stephens (2016) reference below for citation; "normal" is the 2014 DESeq2
shrinkage estimator using a Normal prior.}

\item{max_significance}{The q-value threshold for significance.}

\item{log2FC}{log2FC cutoff.}

\item{rarefy}{Boolean indicating if OTU counts must be rarefyed. This
rarefaction uses the standard R sample function to resample from the
abundance values in the otu_table component of the first argument, physeq.
Often one of the major goals of this procedure is to achieve parity in
total number of counts between samples, as an alternative to other formal
normalization procedures, which is why a single value for the sample.size
is expected. If 'no_seed', rarefaction is performed without a set seed.}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{Recipe}
}
\description{
Differential expression analysis based on the Negative Binomial (a.k.a.
Gamma-Poisson) distribution. This function performs a default analysis
through the steps: 1) estimation of size factors: \code{estimateSizeFactors}. 2)
estimation of dispersion: \code{estimateDispersions}. 3) Negative Binomial GLM
fitting and Wald statistics: nbinomWaldTest. For complete details on each
step, see the manual pages of the respective functions. After the DESeq
function returns a DESeqDataSet object, results tables (log2 fold changes and
p-values) can be generated using the results function. Shrunken LFC can then
be generated using the lfcShrink function.
