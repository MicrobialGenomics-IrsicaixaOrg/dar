\description{
Extract results from defined bake
}
\examples{
data(test_prep_rec)

## First we need to add bakes (extraction strategies) to the prep recipe.
rec <- bake(test_prep_rec)

## Finally we can extract the results with the cool method
cool(rec)

## By default cool extracts the results of the first bake. If we have more
## bakes we can extract the one that you want with the bake parameter.
rec <- bake(rec, count_cutoff = 1)
cool(rec, 2)

## bake and cool methods needs a prep-recipe. If you pass a non-prep recipe
## the output is an error.
data(test_rec)
err <- testthat::expect_error(cool(test_rec))
err
